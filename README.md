# Pokédex Web Application!

## Description

The primary goal of this exercise was to craft a compact web application using a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application's core purpose revolves around interfacing with an external API to provide users with an enriched experience of exploring data points. Within the application's framework, users have the ability to peruse an extensive catalog of Pokémon, delve into basic details for each individual creature, and employ intuitive search functionality to pinpoint Pokémon by name.

# Technical Requirements

- The app pulls data from the Pokémon API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/).
- It shows a list of Pokémon with their names and pictures.
- Users can click on a Pokémon to see more details.
- The app has implemented CSS and Bootstrap.
- It uses JavaScript with strict rules for quality and prettier for neat formatting.
- We use pop-up windows (modals) to show extra Pokémon info.
- The app works smoothly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and even older browsers like IE11.

## Key Features:

- Loading Data: Loading data from an external source via Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/)
- Browse Pokémon: Explore a comprehensive list of Pokémon
- Detailed Information: Click on a Pokémon's name to reveal a modal window with more information about each creature.

## Technologies Used:

To bring this project to life, I harnessed the power of the following technologies:

- HTML: The foundation of our web application.
- CSS: Styling to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
- JavaScript: Adding interactivity and functionality to the Pokédex.
- jQuery: Simplifying DOM manipulation and enhancing user interactions.

### Libraries

- Polyfill: Provides modern functionality in older web browsers that lack support for certain features or APIs.
- Bootstrap: A responsive design framework for a seamless viewing experience on various devices.
